<h1>4-H Global Knowledge Center</h1>
<p>The purpose of the 4-H Global Knowledge Center (GKC) is to help 4-H and similar groups in Africa and around the world use the 4-H model to create sustainable livelihoods and improve economic security for young people. </p>

<p>The GKC offers resources and community-building tools to help 4-H organizers, club leaders, volunteers, parents, and the youth themselves. These tools can help youth take on agriculture projects, find answers to problems, and develop leadership, decision-making, teamwork, and other life skills. This knowledge and these skills will help youth be the solution to their countries’ challenges in the next generation.</p>
